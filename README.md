# AI and Productivity: A Visualization Prototype

This repository contains an early prototype for visualizing Total Factor Productivity (TFP) trends across countries and sectors. It represents the first step in a broader independent research project focused on quantifying how AI adoption is reshaping labor demand, productivity, and economic infrastructure.

The goal of this project is to eventually model the relationship between AI exposure and productivity growth using structured economic data and real-world signals. This initial code sample is designed to demonstrate:
- Technical proficiency with data cleaning, visualization, and interactivity
- The use of Total Factor Productivity as a core metric in economic analysis
- A foundation for building more robust models of AI‚Äôs economic impact

## üöÄ Live App (Streamlit)

Once deployed, a live demo will be available at:
`[Streamlit deployment link will go here]`

The app generates a simple but flexible line chart that allows users to:
- Compare TFP trends across countries
- Visualize productivity changes over time
- Filter by region or sector (depending on data updates)
