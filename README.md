# Impact of AI in Financial Services

This project explores how generative AI adoption is reshaping labor demand and productivity across the financial services sector. It is part of a broader effort to evaluate how AI affects occupational exposure, sectoral value creation, and workforce displacement risks.

Developed using Python and Streamlit, this interactive dashboard is designed for policymakers, economists, and industry leaders seeking to understand where AI adoption is concentrated and which job categories are most at risk or poised to benefit.
