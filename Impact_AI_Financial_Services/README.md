# AI & Labor Productivity in Financial Services: A G7 Comparison

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the microeconomic impact of AI on the financial services sector, using Total Factor Productivity (TFP) data to compare trends across G7 countries. It aims to highlight AI-driven productivity shifts, assess U.S. competitiveness, and inform strategic policy recommendations on labor impact and investment.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze TFP trends in the financial sector across G7 economies.
- Validate U.S. trends with BLS data.
- Assess labor exposure and displacement risks tied to AI adoption.
- Identify policy-relevant investment and reskilling opportunities.

## 🧠 Why This Matters
Policymakers need to understand:
- **Who is affected** by AI-driven change in finance.
- **Where** regional/state labor impacts are likely.
- **What** investment gaps or strategic advantages exist.
- **How** the U.S. stacks up globally on productivity and AI transformation.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data wrangling
- `matplotlib`, `plotly` for visualization
- `scikit-learn` (optional) for modeling
- `streamlit` (optional) for interactive dashboard

## 🧠 AI Assistance Statement
This project was developed with the assistance of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, used to accelerate scaffolding, code writing, and technical planning. All economic framing, interpretation, and research direction are original to the author.

## 📁 Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for data analysis
- `data/` – Raw and cleaned data
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions

## 🔍 Next Steps
1. Download OECD STAN TFP data for ISIC Rev.4 64–66 (Financial & Insurance activities).
2. Clean and align U.S. TFP data from BLS.
3. Generate G7 comparison plots.
4. Begin framing labor impact and regional analysis.

## 📊 Future Add-ons
- GenAI occupational exposure overlay (O*NET, MIT OpenAI scores)
- State-level labor mapping for U.S.
- Policy memo or Streamlit dashboard
